      <description>GDP components over time and among countries
At the risk of oversimplifying things, the main components of gross domestic product, GDP are personal consumption (C), business investment (I), government spending (G) and net exports (exports - imports). You can read more about GDP and the different approaches in calculating at the Wikipedia GDP page.
The GDP data we will look at is from the United Nations’ National Accounts Main Aggregates Database, which contains estimates of total GDP and its components for all countries from 1970 to today.</description>

      <description>By looking at Trump’s Approval Margins over time, we can probably figure out the pattern of his approval rate change.
Let’s see from the past and dig as much deeper as we can!
First, we import the data set. We can also read csv directly from the website. Here we save the csv to local directory for higher speed.
# Import approval polls dataapproval_polllist &amp;lt;- read_csv(here::here(&amp;#39;data&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;approval_polllist.csv&amp;#39;))# or directly off fivethirtyeight website# approval_polllist &amp;lt;- read_csv(&amp;#39;https://projects.</description>
