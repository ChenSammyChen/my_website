<hr />
<p>It is unknown how much the difference in excess deaths due to homicide among black men and suicide among white men vary by US state.</p>
<p>To compare the rates of firearm and non-firearm homicide and suicide in black and white non-Hispanic men by US state and examine their associations with state prevalence of gun ownership.</p>
<p>In analysis part, I not only pointed out the circumstances but also bring out the resolutions in the concept of “cultural appropriation”.</p>

<p>From the plot, we can see that firearm homicide and suicide were strongly associated for white men. In terms of the relationship among firearm homicide, suicide, and state gun prevalence, the 5 states with lower rates of both firearm homicide and suicide in white men(Massachusetts, New Jersey, Rhode Island, New York, Connecticut)also were in the lowest category of reported state gun prevalence.</p>

<p>Among black men, firearm homicide and suicide were modestly associated. States with the lowest reported prevalence of guns had the lowest rates of firearm suicide and below-average rates of firearm homicide. Missouri and several rust belt states reported the most firearm homicides among black men but medium levels of gun ownership.</p>
</div>
<div id="results-further-explanation" class="section level1">
<h1>Results further explanation</h1>
<p>Firearm homicide rates among black men varied substantially across states.
For white men, firearm homicide and suicide shared a strong positive association.
We consider the differences across states for different reasons, including state gun prevalence, alcohol and cultural appropriation.
State gun prevalence was strongly tied to firearm suicide for both black and white man. Alcohol is deeply connected to people’s perception of fear, anger and so on. It also relates to social inequality.</p>

<h1>Cultural appropriation</h1>
<div id="examples" class="section level2">
<h2>Examples</h2>
